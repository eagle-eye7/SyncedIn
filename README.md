# SyncedIn
###Summary
Google Glass is the latest and most mature wearable technology that has been launched for the general public only a few months ago. Only a handful of developers round the globe are developing apps for it, popularly known as Glassware. Thus, I take this unique and interesting opportunity to be one of them. "SyncedIn" will be targeting the daily commuters and will help them remain synced with their interests during their usual commutes. It will be an interplay of touch and voice commands.

###Methodology
Agile methodology will be adopted in the development of this glassware. This methodology is best suited for projects with short and strict deadlines. It involves dividing the entire time duration into sprints. Each sprint has a specific target and a deliverable. Thus, the project is completed in chunks and every chunk consists of at least one tangible feature.
